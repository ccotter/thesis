\section{Related Work}

Many systems attempt to alleviate and control the effects of nondeterminism.
The Velodrome~\cite{flanagan2008velodrome} and
SingleTrack~\cite{sadowski2009singletrack} tools dynamically check atomicity and
determinism constraints in user programs to report possible race conditions or
the potential to execute nondeterministically. Replay debuggers like Instant
Replay~\cite{leblanc1987debugging} record all relevant inputs and thread
interactions to execute a program in a repeatable fashion for debugging
purposes. However, these tools are expensive in terms of run time overhead and
storage. None of these tools do anything to fix the inherently
nondeterministic environment in which developers write programs.

Bocchino et al. provide deterministic language extensions to Java at the cost
of having to rewrite parallel applications using new a new type
system~\cite{bocchino2009type}.
