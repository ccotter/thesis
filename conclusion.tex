\section{Conclusion}

Determinator introduced a novel parallel programming model that completely
removes nondeterminism to provide predictability to user programs. Our work
implemented Determinator's programming model in Linux and showed it is possible
to efficiently run deterministic parallel applications on large input sizes.
Improvements to our kernel implementation, enriching our user library, and
upcoming hardware support for transactional memory may reduce the unacceptable
overhead for parallel applications when run on small inputs.
